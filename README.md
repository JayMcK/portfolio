# My Portfolio - Jay McKenzie

Please visit the post-NextJS migration live site here: www.jaymckenzie.co.uk

## Introduction

My Porfolio is a Single Page Web Application designed using Figma. Initially developed using create-react-app then migrated to Next.js for SEO Optimization and Server Side Rendering. JavaScript, React & Material UI were used to build this Front-End. This Web Application is linked to a Node.js back-end email service, hosted on Heroku, built by me.

This repo is for the project pre-NextJS migration.
